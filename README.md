## Overview

My personal Geektools build out with all necessary files and external library citations.  Geektools allows for full customization of Mac desktop space.  An essential component to the aesthetically driven Apple product user, Geektools can be found in a wide variety of places across the internet.

## Installation
You must install Geektools from the following address: 
http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/download.php

Provided code must be dropped into a Geektools "Geeklet" in the type "File."  The codes should be placed in the command line of the properties box that appears.  Please select refresh rates that are logical and as long as possible.  Constantly running geeklets in the background process of your computer can cause significant battery drainage.  Place geeklets and size them to your own specification.  Use "Keep on Top," background color blocks, and alignment as you see necessary.


## Code Examples
A useful forum has developed and can be found here:

## External Libraries
I make use of 1 external library that I find extremely useful for running Geektools on your desktop.  The icalbuddy process pulls data from your ical account and can place specific calendar designations as a bulleted list in a Geeklet "File" block.  I use a "File" geeklet to call a calendar group that I name "Desktop," knowing that anything in that calendar group will appear on my desktop through the Geektools and icalbuddy combination.  The external library can be found here:
